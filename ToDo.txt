Doing:
    - implement cookie storage and retrieval between visits
    - put in a gutter on left and right when above certain screen size
        - How to do breakpoints with styled-components?

ToDo:
    - Get lines from tin
    - Do we create an obnoxious "win" button that has a coresponding discord bot to do messages?
    - add max width to bingocells (grid-column-max??)
    - Create button to get new card


Done:
    - Create layout components
    - cell
    - card
    - create mocked service to provide static PoC data
        - How do we crowd-source the lines / ideas?
        - pull from github repo?
        - merge requests to add more ideas to it?
    - How do we validate the crowd-sourced ideas so they aren't all total shit?
    - figure out how to store the bingo cards after generation?
        - database?
        - cookie?
        - don't at all and let people take pictures? kind of defeats the purpose
